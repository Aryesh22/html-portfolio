<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Aryesh Singh, a dedicated student currently pursuing a Dual Degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) at LNMIIT.</p>
<p>I’m deeply passionate about sports, and proud to have competed as a national-level table tennis player. Beyond academics and athletics, I enjoy unwinding by watching engaging web series, always on the lookout for a good story.</p>
<p>I’m someone who believes in balancing discipline with passion — whether it’s solving a technical problem, competing on the table, or diving into a new show.</p>
